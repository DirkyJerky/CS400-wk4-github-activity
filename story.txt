There was a person, who went to walk their dog one afternoon.  After walking for a bit, they saw their friend, out walking two dogs.  Last the first person remembered, their friend had only one dog. "Did you get a new dog?", the first person asked.  "Yes, I wanted a new friend in these trying times."  "Mind if I walk with you?", the friend asked.
