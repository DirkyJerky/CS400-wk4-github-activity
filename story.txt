There was a person, who went to walk their dog one afternoon.  After walking for a bit, they saw their friend, out walking two dogs.  Last the first person remembered, their friend had only one dog. "Did you get a new dog?", the first person asked.  "Yes, I wanted a new friend in these trying times."  "Mind if I walk with you?", the friend asked.

The two friends and their three dogs continued. "Why did you choose to walk today?" the first person asked. "I am not sure," their friend responded. The two trekked on in silence. Before long, they came across the town square. It was softly quiet - the only sounds were their steps hitting the cement and the slow rustling of leaves as the wind blew by. "Look," the friend says, "there is a line of people over there."
